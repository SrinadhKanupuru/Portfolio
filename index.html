    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>📌 Plagiarism Detection using Machine Learning (Text & Image) – Main Project</strong><br>
            Designed and implemented a Python-based plagiarism checker that detects both text and image plagiarism using natural language processing and image analysis techniques.
            The system uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity (via scikit-learn) for text similarity, while image comparison is achieved using structural similarity index (SSIM) and perceptual hashing (pHash).

            <em><strong>Abstract:</strong></em><br>
            This project aims to identify and flag content duplication across textual and visual mediums. For text, the system analyzes sentence structure and semantic similarity using vector-based models.
            For images, the tool computes perceptual hashes and structural features to detect copied or slightly modified visuals. The system supports document uploads and image files, providing a similarity score and visual indication of detected plagiarism.
            This project helped reinforce concepts in machine learning, feature extraction, NLP, and computer vision.
